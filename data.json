This works without a problem in VS 2010, but when I use VS 2013 I get an error stating that dynamic operations can only be performed in homogeneous AppDomain.   The project is targeting .NET framework 4.0 and is an asp.net MVC project.</p>\n\n<p>I tried changing legacyCasModel to \"false\", but then I can't access the object I need. Not sure how to resolve this issue. How can I use legacyCasModel=\"true\" in VS2013 with dynamic expressions?    </p>",
